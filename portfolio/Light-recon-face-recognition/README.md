## 🔧 Usage

### Main Application

Run the main application to launch the advanced face recognition system:

```bash
python main.py
```

Controls:
- Press `F` to toggle fullscreen mode
- Press `ESC` or `Q` to quit
- Press `D` to toggle detailed profile view

### Face Scanner Tool

Use the face scanner tool to add new people to the database:

```bash
python face_scanner.py
```

Controls:
- Press `C` to manually capture an image
- Press `A` to toggle auto-capture mode
- Press `Q` to quit

## 🔍 How It Works

L1GHT REC0N uses a multi-stage approach for face recognition:

1. **Face Detection**: Uses a pre-trained Caffe model to locate faces in the video stream
2. **Feature Extraction**: Utilizes OpenFace neural network to extract 128-dimensional feature vectors from each detected face
3. **Face Recognition**: Compares extracted feature vectors with known faces using cosine similarity
4. **Profile Display**: Shows detailed profile information with dynamic visual elements for recognized individuals

The system stores profile information in individual JSON files, making it easy to manage and update details for each person.

## 📷 Face Scanning Process

The face registration system allows you to:
1. Create a new profile for a person with customizable attributes
2. Capture multiple images of the person's face from different angles
3. Automatically detect and extract faces from captured images
4. Save profile information and face images for future recognition

## 💻 GPU Acceleration

L1GHT REC0N supports GPU acceleration through CUDA when available. To use GPU acceleration:

1. Install OpenCV with CUDA support:
   ```bash
   pip uninstall opencv-python
   pip install opencv-contrib-python-cuda
   ```

2. Make sure you have NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit installed
3. The application will automatically detect and use CUDA if available

## 👥 Profile System

Each profile contains detailed information about an individual:

- Basic information (name, age, gender)
- Demographic data (nationality, occupation)
- System-specific data (status, threat level, sighting count)
- Notes and additional information
- Last seen timestamp

## 🛠️ Customization

L1GHT REC0N can be customized in several ways:

- Modify profile attributes in the `PersonProfile` class
- Adjust detection parameters for improved performance
- Customize the visual interface by modifying the draw functions
- Add new profile fields by updating the profile schema
